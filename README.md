### Background:

The advancement of society and technology has made the world pay more attention to environmental issues, and the trend of electric motors to replace traditional mechanical engines has become more and more clear. Meanwhile, the automation of driving has also become an important part of this technological revolution. This includes the large-scale industrial platforms of automobile companies and the needs of individuals for motor vehicles to complete small daily life tasks. Under this demand, we have developed a motor-driven trolley on a semi-mature hardware platform using C and C++ language which can be remotely controlled and can be equipped with various expansion devices. The application field can be production activities such as site management.
